  <h1>Varanasi</h1>
  <p>Varanasi (Vārāṇasī; [ʋaːˈraːɳəsi]) is a city on the

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganges">Ganges</a>

    river in northern India that has a central place in pilgrimage,
    death, and mourning in the Hindu world,[11][12][13] even as the traditions are transformed in the face of modernization,
    generational changes and emigration.[14][15] The name Varanasi was officially so revived after 1947,[16] but the city is
    still widely known by its earlier name Banaras or Benares (Banāras; [bəˈnaːrəs] (listen)),[17][18] and its ancient name Kashi.
    [19][20] Located in the middle-Ganges valley in the southeastern part of the state of Uttar Pradesh, Varanasi lies on the left bank of
    the river.It is 692 kilometres (430 mi) to the southeast of India's capital New Delhi, 320 kilometres (200 mi) south-east of the state
    capital,

    and 121 kilometres (75 mi) east of Prayagraj, another Hindu pilgrimage site.

  <em>Varanasi is one of the world's oldest continually inhabited cities.[21] Kashi, its ancient name, was associated
    with a kingdom of the same name of 2,500 years ago. The Buddha is recorded in the Pali canon to have given his first sermon,
    "The Setting in Motion of the Wheel of Dharma", at nearby Sarnath in 528 BCE. In the 8th century, Adi Shankara established the
    worship of Shiva as an official sect of Varanasi. Since ancient times, the city has been an important centre of Hindu devotion,
    pilgrimage, mysticism and poetry contributing to its cultural importance.[22] Tulsidas wrote his Awadhi language epic, the Ramcharitmanas,
    a Bhakti movement reworking of the Sanskrit Ramayana, in Varanasi.</em>

  <h3>Etymology</h3>
  <p>Traditional etymology links "Varanasi" to the names of two Ganges tributaries forming the city's borders: Varuna, still flowing in
    northern Varanasi, and Assi, today a small stream in the southern part of the city, near Assi Ghat. The old city is located on the north
    shores of the Ganges, bounded by Varuna and Assi.[32]</p>
